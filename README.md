# Smart Document Assistant

## Overview

The Document Interaction Platform allows users to upload various types of documents (PDF, CSV, DOCX, TXT) and interact with them using text or voice queries. It supports both text-based and voice-based interactions, provides document summarization, and utilizes state-of-the-art language models and speech recognition technologies.

### Features
- **Document Upload**: Supports PDF, CSV, DOCX, and TXT files.
- **Text Query**: Allows users to submit text queries to retrieve relevant information from the documents.
- **Voice Query**: Enables users to ask questions through voice commands.
- **Summarization**: Provides a summary of the document content.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts text responses into speech for auditory feedback.

## Technologies

- **LangChain**: Framework for managing and using language models.
- **Google Generative AI**: For generating answers based on document content.
- **FAISS**: Library for efficient similarity search and clustering.
- **Transformers**: For summarization using pre-trained models.
- **SpeechRecognition**: For speech-to-text conversion.
- **gTTS**: Google Text-to-Speech for converting text to speech.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web interface.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
